        <b>Q1) Interest in App Inventor</b>
        <br><br>
        I have been developing Android Apps for last 3 years and can
        use my knowledge to contribute in Open Source Projects like MIT App Inventor.
        Through this project, I would like to understand what exactly
        users expect from a visual programming environment and 
        implement the same in App Inventor. I’ll try to finish as many 
        features as I can during my Google Summer of Code coding period
        and work on the rest after that as people keep suggesting better ones.
        I strongly believe that along with providing better performance to the
        current audience, this project will help magnify the audience of 
        App Inventor.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> 
        <b>Q2) Interest in introductory programming</b>
        <br><br>
        I have taken few sessions on android development workshops organized
        in VIT. Sessions were mostly about teaching Fundamentals 
        of Android development like Intents, Fragments, Activity Life Cycle,
        Recycler View etc. on Android Studio. I'm also an active member of 
        VIT android club where we are introducing new teaching methodology for
        app building using App Inventor tool. 
    </p>
    <br>

        <b>Q3) Proposed summer projects</b>
        <br><br>
        I want to work on either of these proposed summer projects -
        <b>
            <ul>
                    <li>Improvements in ListView (Component Projects)</li>

        <b>Q4) Experience with the development tools</b>
        <br><br>
        <ol>
            <li><b>JAVA</b>: <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                I have started learning JAVA 3 years ago and since then I have been 
                using it as my primary coding language. I use it mainly for purpose
                of developing android apps and have expertise in OOP concepts, Polymorphism and available Data Structures
                like LinkedList, TreeMaps etc. I have also done a research on implementation
                of MapReduce techniques over cluster using Spark open source Library
                where Java was used to generate test cases with computation extensive 
                ML Algorithms that has to be executed over the standalone cluster of 3 nodes in order to compare it's performance with Hadoop cluster.

                <b>Android development with the Java SDK</b>:
                <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                I have developed 15+ android applications till now and have good amount of knowledge 
                in google's android sdk. In my projects, I have used many sdk packages like 
                Recycler View implementation with custom Adapters and layouts,
                Visualization Libraries like MPAndroid Chart, Library Extensions like Bluetooth Serial Communication
                to allow faster communication between barcode scanner and app using a raspberry pi. I also have knowledge
                of handling emulators, adb tools and usage of gradle dependencies, maven repositories which are widely used for importing external
                libraries into a project. Few other complex concepts, for e.g. Fragment Transitions inside View Pagers, User Customized Navigation Bars, 
                SQLiteDatabase Handling, Realtime Firebase Database in collaboration with ElasticSearch for faster searching has also been implemented.

                <b>JavaScript</b>:
                <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative 
                (e.g. functional programming) styles. I have used it for the backend logic of my websites. Express.js, joi, request etc. are some of the widely
                used Node.js modules  which I have used for my projects. Javascript servelets and applets are some of the other important concepts one should know about.

        <b>Q5) Experience with teams, online developer communities and large code bases</b>
        <br><br>
        I like working in a team and appreciate the opportunity to gain insight and feedback from colleagues. I have worked on teams where one or two voices tend to dominate
        the group, and other peoples’ ideas are not heard. I try to be a good listener in teams, taking the time to understand everyone’s ideas, and making 
        sure everyone’s suggestions are discussed. My team has recently secured 2<sup>nd</sup> position in Sociothon, a 24 hrs Hackathon event on Social issues in India.
        I was also the Senior Android Developer for almost 1 year in Kirana, an early phase startup where my team has successfully developed an e-commerce application for 
        small grocery stores shopkeepers under my mentorship. I often try to interact on large developer communities like Stack-overflow and GitHub to gain insights and provide solutions to an unsolved problem.

        <b>Challenge 2: Design challenge --  Improving App Inventor</b>
        <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Issue 1: <a href="https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources/issues/1128">Add helpString to Designer Properties #1128 </a></b>   ---> <a href="https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources/pull/1647">[ PR - #1647 (open) ]</a>
                <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                The underlying cause behind this issue is that, the app inventor source code do not have translations of the <i>simple property descriptions</i> into
                other languages--they are hard-coded in the <code>@SimpleProperty</code> annotation rather than being described in <i>OdeMessages.java</i>. This issue 
                can be solved by changing source codes at few file locations viz. - 
                <ul>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b><code>../components/annotations/DesignerProperty.java</code></b> : by adding the new field for <b>description</b> as shown in the snippet below -  
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="img1.png" alt="DesignerProperty code snippet" height="300" width="400">
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b><code>../components/scripts/ComponentDescriptorGenerator.java</code></b> : by Updating <b>ComponentDescriptionGenerator</b> to include the new field in the json description 
                        of the property as shown in the snippet -  
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="img2.png" alt="DesignerProperty code snippet" height="300" width="400">
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Then finally update the branch that includes the property <i>helpstrings</i> in the UI that will use this code to display description in UI.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                The abbreviated design will look like this with a <q>?</q> symbol button for viewing description of Designer properties.
                <br><br>
                <img src="img3.png" alt="DesignerProperty code snippet" height="100" width="200">

            <br><br>
            <li>
                <b>Issue 2: <a href="https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources/issues/1015">Update Texting documentation regarding Google Voice #1015 </a></b>   ---> <a href="https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources/pull/1648">[ PR - #1648 (open) ]</a>
                <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                The underlying cause behind this issue is that, The texting component can send with GV, but can no longer 
                receive due to breaking changes introduced by Google in Google Voice App. This issue can be solved by changing source codes at file location - 
                <b><code>../docs/reference/components/social.html</code></b> : and edit the description for <b>Texting Component</b> of App Inventor.
                <br>
                The abbreviated design will look something like this - 
                <br><br>
                <img src="img4.png" alt="DesignerProperty code snippet" height="100" width="900">
            </li>
